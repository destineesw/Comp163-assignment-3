Semester Life Simulation Game
Project Overview

This project is a text-based decision-making game that simulates the challenges of a college semester. The player takes on the role of a student making choices about course load, study strategies, and social life. Each decision influences key statistics such as GPA, study hours, social points, and stress level. By the end of the game, the accumulated decisions determine the player’s final outcome for the semester.

Branching Concepts Demonstrated:

The program demonstrates multiple Python branching and decision-making concepts:

if/elif/else with comparison operators (>=, <=, ==, !=):
Implemented in the course load decision (Step 2), where GPA and workload affect stress and study hours.

Membership operators (in, not in) with logical operators (and, or, not):
Implemented in the study strategy decision (Step 3), where study subject choices are validated against a list and outcomes affect GPA and social points.

Identity operators (is, is not):
Implemented in the final semester assessment (Step 4) for type checking and outcome evaluation.

Nested if statements:
Used in Step 4 to combine multiple conditions and generate different endings based on GPA, stress, and social life.

How to Run the Game

Open the file [Destiny wilson]_assignment_3.py using Python 3.

Run the file in a terminal or an IDE such as IDLE, VS Code, or PyCharm.

Follow the prompts to make decisions about course load, study strategies, and social life.

At the end, review your final statistics and see which ending you earned.

Possible Endings

The game includes multiple endings that reflect different outcomes of a student’s semester:

Graduate with honors and a strong social life

Graduate with honors but weak social connections

Maintain a healthy balance between academics and social activities

Pass the semester but struggle with time management

Experience burnout from stress

Struggle academically due to poor study or social choices

AI Assistance

Some portions of the code structure and documentation were developed with guidance from ChatGPT. However, all customization, decision logic, and final implementation were completed by the student.
